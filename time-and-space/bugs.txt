- Scroll bar moves back to halfway point after overall container hits end (bottom, bottom), does not show any additional HTML content
    - suspect the issue is with pinning
- On refresh, if scroll was not at the starting point, the content that should be on the page at that point in the scroll, is not on the page
    - might also be related to pinning, but could be a timeline issue or a dynamic generation of JS content issue

- Question: reversing animations, overriding animations in the timeline
- allow single, repeating animations to run while applying timeline animations
