                    Cropped parts of different stolen, illegal, or contested museum artifacts that depict some (human?)
                    figure load in. Ideally, the cropped images would be composed into a full body (head, torso, 2 arms,
                    2 legs, but this might have to be adjusted based on the content available) to emphasize the
                    fragmentation and displacement
                    of artifacts from its place of origin.
